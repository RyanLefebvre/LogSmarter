    Should I Bulk or Cut?
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    The decision between bulking and cutting can be difficult for
    someone who is new to taking a periodised approach to their nutrition. Below, our CSO Dr, Brandon Roberts
    gives some scenarios that might help you. The scenarios apply to both males and females with regard to calories
    because the relative increase in muscle mass is the same between genders (Roberts et al., 2020). However, there are
    differences in body fat percentage between genders which are important to distinguish because females have higher
    baseline percentages.

    Inexperienced
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    In the following three scenarios I use the term inexperienced. This applies to people who have not been training
    regularly, or in an evidence-based fashion for at least 1-2 years. This generally applies to most people in high
    school and college unless you have had a good coach or are well-read in the scientific literature. In general, you
    will likely grow muscle no matter what path you choose.
</div>
<div class="scenarioTitle lsThemeText">
    Scenario #1 - Inexperienced + lean/skinny
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    You have less than two years of experience resistance training on a consistent basis (4-5 days per week). You want
    to maximize your muscle growth during this phase. You’re very skinny and comfortable with putting on some fat as
    long as it comes with muscle.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    You will grow the most in your first 2-3 years of resistance training. Most people increase muscle mass from 8-15
    lbs during this time as long as they are eating enough protein (>1.8g/kg/body weight). So, in this scenario, you
    would want to be in a surplus. The ideal surplus would probably be a moderate or aggressive approach since you’re
    already lean if you don’t mind putting on a few extra pounds of fat.
</div>

<div class="scenarioTitle lsThemeText">
    Scenario #2 - Inexperienced + overweight
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    You have less than two years of experience resistance training on a consistent basis (4-5 days per week). You want
    to maximize your muscle growth during this phase. You’re overweight and not as comfortable with putting as much fat.
    In this case, I would suggest you stick with your maintenance calories until you hit a long training plateau or have
    another 1-2 years of training experience. You can still gain muscle and may even undergo recomposition if you are
    eating enough protein (>1.8g/kg/bodyweight).
</div>

<div class="scenarioTitle lsThemeText">
    Scenario #3 - Inexperienced + obese
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    You have less than two years of experience resistance training on a consistent basis (4-5 days per week). You want
    to lose weight to feel more comfortable or for health reasons. In this case, I would suggest you try a moderate
    (-300-500kcal/day) or aggressive (-500-750kcal/day) approach until you are normal weight (by BMI standards) or reach
    your desired body fat level.
</div>

<div class="subResourcesTitle lsThemeText">
    Experienced
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    In the following three scenarios I use the term experienced. This applies to people who have been training regularly
    using an evidence-based approach for 3+ years. In general, this applies to most people who have graduated from their
    undergraduate or have recently become much more interested in fitness. You still have not reached your genetic
    limits and will grow muscle with the appropriate nutrition and training program.
</div>

<div class="scenarioTitle lsThemeText">
    Scenario #1 - Experienced (3+ years) + lean
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    You’ve been training for a number of years and have busted through many training plateaus. You have also completed
    at least one or two bulks/cuts. Your protein intake is moderate to high (1.8-2.2g/kg/bw) and you have a good handle
    on your nutrition. You’re fairly lean (Body fat = 8-12% for males, 16-20% for females), so you should bulk at a
    moderate (+250-500kcal/day) or conservative (+100-250kcal/day) rate for as long as possible. You want to squeeze all
    the muscle you can out of your bulking phases before you reach the advanced stage.
</div>

<div class="scenarioTitle lsThemeText">
    Scenario #2 - Experienced (3+ years) + overweight
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    You’ve been training for a number of years and have busted through many training plateaus. You have also completed
    at least one or two bulks/cuts. Your protein intake is moderate to high (1.8-2.2g/kg/bw) and you have a decent
    handle on your nutrition. You’re slightly heavier than you want to be (Body fat = 18-25% for males, 26-30% for
    females) and want to cut for the summer, an event, or so you can set up your next bulk. You should probably cut at a
    moderate (-300-500kcal/day) or aggressive (-500-750kcal/day) approach. You should maintain your muscle mass fairly
    well as long as you don’t go below ~6-8% body fat.
</div>

<div class="scenarioTitle lsThemeText">
    Scenario #3 - Experienced (3+ years) + obese
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    You’ve been training for a number of years and have busted through many training plateaus. You may have never tried
    to cut before. Your protein intake is moderate to high (1.8-2.2g/kg/bw) but you haven’t been tracking your nutrition
    or have gotten off track due to life (it happens). You’re much heavier than you want to be, but have a solid base of
    muscle. You want to cut to for health reasons, to be leaner in general, and potentially to set up your next bulk
    (not recommended). You should probably cut with an aggressive (-500-750kcal/day) or very aggressive
    (-750-1000kcal/day) approach. You’ll want to have a higher protein intake than most people during your cut
    (2.5-3.5g/kg/bw).
</div>

<div class="subResourcesTitle lsThemeText">
    Advanced
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    In the following three scenarios I use the term advanced. This applies to people who have been training regularly
    using an evidence-based fashion for at least 5+ years. In general, you have tried a lot of training programs, and
    know what foods to eat during a bulk/cut. You have almost reached your genetic limit and will grow only a minimal
    muscle with the appropriate nutrition and training program. It will probably take a year or longer to see an
    increase in muscle in a picture.
</div>

<div class="scenarioTitle lsThemeText">
    Scenario #1 - Advanced (5+ years) + lean
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    You’ve been training for a long time now. It’s part of your routine and you have probably figured out which training
    methods work best for you. Your protein intake is high (2.2+ g/kg/bw) and you have a very good handle on your
    nutrition. You’re fairly lean (Body fat = 10-12% for males, 14-18% for females). You should do a conservative bulk
    (+100-250kcal/day). You aren’t going to grow muscle quickly and a higher surplus may result in a shorter bulk, which
    could minimize your muscle growth before you feel the need to cut.
</div>

<div class="scenarioTitle lsThemeText">
    Scenario #2 - Advanced (5+ years) + overweight
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    You’ve been training for a long time now. It’s part of your routine and you have probably figured out which training
    methods work best for you. Your protein intake is high (2.2+g/kg/bw) and you have a decent handle on your nutrition.
    You’re a bit overweight (20-25% body fat). You should cut and the best approach is probably from our moderate
    (-300-500kcal/day) or aggressive (-500-750kcal/day) approach. You should maintain your muscle mass fairly well as
    long as you don’t get too lean (Body fat less than 8% for males, less than 12% for females). Pay attention to your
    training and recovery and adjust your deficit as needed.

    Scenario #3 - Advanced (5+ years) + obese
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
    You’ve been training for a long time now. It’s part of your routine and you have probably figured out which training
    methods work best for you. Your protein intake is high (2.2+g/kg/bw) and you have a very good handle on your
    nutrition in general. You’re a good bit overweight (30+% body fat) and obese by BMI standards. You should cut and
    your best method is probably our aggressive (-500-750kcal/day) or very aggressive (-750-1000kcal/day) approach.
    You’ll want to have a higher protein than most (2.5-3.5g/kg/bw). You don’t have to worry about losing muscle for a
    long time.
